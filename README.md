![](simulation/Banner.jpg)
## **_Overview of the course_**
In this 'CMOS CIRCUIT DESIGN & SPICE SIMULATION WORKSHOP' conducted by [VLSI System Design]( https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/).We have learned About MOSFET construction,Regions of Operation,characteristic curves ,Drain current equation models.Factors such as velocity saturation effect that affect MOSFET operation was also discussed .CMOS logic for inverter is introduced & it's Voltage transfer characteristics are studied.Effects on varying the PMOS channel dimensions on Switching threshold voltage,Delays,Noise margins are studied,Emphasis was made on Robustness of CMOS during the study.Finally the effect of varying power supply input of CMOS on Voltage transfer characteristics,Gain,Energy consumption & performance(delays) were studied.All the above topic were discussed in detail theoretically & are also simulated using SPICE SIMULATION.The Simulation results obtained are found to be inaccordance with the Theory that was discussed.
